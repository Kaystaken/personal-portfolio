# My Personal Porfolio
## Description

### Motivation

I'm currently attending a bootcamp for web deveolpment and wanted to start a porfolio to show my deployed projects to hiring managers. 

### Why?

Viewing my projects and porfolio will allow potential employers to assess whether I'm a good candidate for the role they're looking to fill, give them ways of contacting me and tell them a little about me.

### Problem Solved

I had no way of showing my work prior to creating this portfolio. Having one will allow me to add future projects as I deploy more. Also creating this repo gave me practise using the advanced css styles we learned in mod 2 of the bootcamp.

### Learnings

I learned that you can spend a lot of time styling your page in css and get very creative and incorporate a lot different styles. Commiting often is important and your commit messages should be descriptive. Identation is very important to keep the page organized and easier to read.
